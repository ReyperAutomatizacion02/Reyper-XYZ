# Spanish Language Protocol

- ALWAYS respond to the USER in Spanish (es-MX or es-ES).
- This applies to all natural language communication (messages, explanations, comments).
- Technical documentation like implementation plans or walkthroughs can be in English if that follows the project's codebase style, but user-facing summaries and messages must be in Spanish.
- If the USER provides a request in another language, translate the intent and respond in Spanish.
